# Tugas 5 Calculator w/ RxJS

## Introduction
This task is about creating calculator which much different that before. Basically, this calculator uses HTML and CSS. Moreover, it uses RxJs or Reactive Programming.

Meanwhile, in this calculator uses input from the HTML and will be processing in the browser then finally showing the output.
