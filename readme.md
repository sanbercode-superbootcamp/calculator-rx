# Tugas 5 Calculator w/ RxJS

## Introduction
This task is about creating calculator which much different that before. Basically, this calculator uses HTML and CSS. Moreover, it uses RxJs or Reactive Programming. As I have got from the instructor, Reactive Programming is building structure of the proses. Then the data will flow to the  structure and after that returning the output. Meanwhile, in this calculator uses input from the HTML and will be processing in the browser then finally showing the output.
